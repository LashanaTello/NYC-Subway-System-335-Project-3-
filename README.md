# Project: NYC Tree Collection
## CSCI 335

This project can be viewed [here](http://www.compsci.hunter.cuny.edu/~sweiss/course_materials/csci335/assignments/project2.pdf).

For this project, the goal was to create something like a database for all the trees in New York City and allow users to query the database. 

The queries users can make are:
- get the total number of trees in a specific borough
- get the total number of trees that are a certain species
- get the total number of trees in a zipcode
- get all the names of all the tree species in NYC
- get all trees within a specific distance of latitude-longitude coordinates

This project could be useful for environmental groups. Perhaps they want to replace all the dead trees in NYC and plant new ones. This program will tell them how many dead trees are in NYC and will help them find them.

(_**Note**: the data file storing all the trees in NYC is too big to upload here. It can be found [here](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/2015-Street-Tree-Census-Tree-Data/uvpi-gqnh) and you can export it as a CSV file. But, the data on trees in Manhattan only is small enough to upload so only that is in this repository._)
