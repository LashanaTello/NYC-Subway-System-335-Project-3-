  Description    : The interface file for the TreeCollection class
  Purpose        : To store all trees in the NYC Tree Census of 2015
  Usage          : To serve as a database of trees in NYC and allow user to 
									 query about information about a certain tree species, trees 
									 within a user-given distance, latitude, and longitude, and 
									 trees within a zipcode

/*******************************************************************************

		The TreeCollection class acts as database for the 2015 NYC Street Tree 
		Census. It encapsulates an AVL Tree, a TreeSpecies object, and an array that
		stores integers. The AVL Tree stores all the Tree objects. The TreeSpecies 
		object stores the common names of all the Tree species, which is the 
		spc_common member of each Tree object, and is responsible for determining 
		if a given string matches any of the species names it stores. The array 
		stores the number of Trees in New York City and the number of Trees in each 
		borough. The TreeCollection class must be used with an enumerated type 
		named Borough. A variable of type Borough can have a value equal to 
		ALLBOROS, MANHATTAN, BRONX, BROOKLYN, QUEENS, or STATEN. These enumerated 
		values will be used to represent the indices in the array. Which means each 
		index represents a borough. ALLBOROS represents data that includes all 5 
		boroughs. So, trees_by_borough_[ALLBOROS] returns the total number of 
		trees in New York City. This way you don't have to remember which spot in 
		the array stores information for which borough. Also, TreeCollection stores
		all dead Trees and stumps, so they will be inlcuded in all information
		that TreeCollection outputs. If the user wants to know about dead Trees 
		and stumps only, give TreeCollection's tree_info method a string 
		consisting of only a space character. When Trees are dead or stumps, they
		have no spc_common member. So, when their spc_common is output, it will be
		shown as "Unknown".
